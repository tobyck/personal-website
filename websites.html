    var list = [`<b>Hangman Attack<br>Jun '21</b><br><br>
    
    This website can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack" target="_blank">dictionary attack</a> the current state of a hangman game and return some possible words that it could be. To use it, go to <a href="https://hmnattack.surge.sh" target="_blank">hmnattack.surge.sh</a>, enter the current game state e.g. cr_at___, then click search.`, 
    
    `<b>Task List<br>Feb '22</b><br><br>
    
    This is a task list I made with a very minimal design, unlike many others that I've tried before. To add a task to the list, enter the name of the task into the box at the top, and press enter. To check off a task, click on it, and to delete it completely, double click on it. You can also change the urgency of a task my right clicking on it. To move tasks up or down thw list, drag and drop them. You can see this project at <a href="https://mytasklist.surge.sh" target="_blank">mytasklist.surge.sh</a>.`, 
    
    `<b>Hex Guess<br>May '21</b><br><br>

    This is a fun game I made with JavaScript, which involves guessing and or calculating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" target="_blank">hexadecimal</a> colour codes, and picking the correct one out of a 3x3 grid. You can play it at <a href="https://hexguess.surge.sh" target="_blank">hexguess.surge.sh</a>.`,

    `<b>MagCo<br>Mar '22</b><br><br>
    
    MagCo is a basic clicker game which is based around making and selling magnets. As you progress in the game, you can buy factories and workers to make magnets automatically, auto-sellers and advertisements to sell magnets, and stronger magnet types which sell for more money. To beat the game become richer than Elon Musk who, at the time of making this is the richest person in the world. You can play MagCo at <a href="https://magco.surge.sh" target="_blank">magco.surge.sh</a>.`,

    `<b>Markov Chain<br>Oct '21</b><br><br>
    
    This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" target="_blank">Markov chain</a> that generates text. On <a href="https://github.com/TobyCK/markov-chain" target="_blank">GitHub</a> You can see the code for both the JS version and a <a href="https://docs.paperspace.com/machine-learning/wiki/weights-and-biases" target="_blank">weighted</a> version built in Python. If you'd like try it out, you can do that <a href="https://markovchain.surge.sh" target="_blank">here</a>.`,

    `<b>YR10 School Project<br>Mar '22</b><br><br>
    
    This is my school project for year 10 computer science, although it's very simple, I did add some nice animations including the wavey title animation which you can see on my <a href="modules">modules page</a>. This project can be found at <a href="https://tobyck.surge.sh/school/com/main" target="_blank">tobyck.surge.sh/school/com/main</a> (Images will take a while to load).`,
    
    `<b>Text Pad<br>Jan '22</b><br><br>

    This is a text pad I made a while ago when I was learning the basics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JS</a>, but it was very buggy, so I've fixed it up. You can use Ctrl+S to download your work (although, it'll will stay in the editor automatically, even if you close the tab or your browser), and Ctrl+L to toggle between light and dark mode. I spent a while trying to add an option to open local .txt files, although I haven't been able to get it working yet. You can use this at <a href="https://mytextpad.surge.sh" target="_blank">mytextpad.surge.sh</a>.`, 
    
    `<b>Quadratic Rules<br>Aug '21</b><br><br>

    This was inspired by some homework I had for finding quadratic rules from a table. To use the tool, enter three x values, and three y values, and click calculate. This will return the quadratic rule for the values provided. It can also return a linear equation if the pattern has a constant difference. You can check it out at <a href="https://quadratics.surge.sh" target="_blank">quadratics.surge.sh</a>.`, 

    `<b>Stopwatch<br>Feb '22</b><br><br>
    
    Like <a onclick="goto(3)" href="#">my text pad</a>, I made this a while ago, but it wasn't quite accurate and it only sort-of worked. Now it's all working and accurate, so you can use it at <a href="https://thestopwatch.surge.sh" target="_blank">thestopwatch.surge.sh</a>. Click anywhere on the screen or press the space bar to start/stop the timer, press the 'R' key or backspace to reset it, Ctrl/Cmd + D to toggle dark mode.`,
    
    `<b>Vigenère Calculator<br>Aug '21</b><br><br>
    
    This is a online tool I made for encrypting and decrypting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher" target="_blank">Vigenère cipher</a>. I created this with my first few hours of learning JavaScript, so it's nothing fancy. You can try it out at <a href="https://vigenerecipher.surge.sh" target="_blank">vigenerecipher.surge.sh</a>.`], proj = 0;

    $(".main").html(list[proj]);

    document.addEventListener("keyup", event => {
        if (event.keyCode == 37) {
            last();
        } else if (event.keyCode == 39) {
            next();
        }
