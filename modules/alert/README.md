## Dialog Boxes

To use this module include the following script in your site:
```html
<script src="https://tobyck.surge.sh/modules/alert/alert.js"></script>
```
Then in your code you can use the alert function as you normally would, except with option width and height variables, and the ability to use basic markdown for links, and italicised and bolded text. Some examples are below:
```js
alert("Hello!\n\n[This](https://example.com) is a link.\n*This is italicised*,\n**Bolded**,\n***and both!***");

alert("You can change the width and height too!", "300px", "200px");
```
You can see a demonstration at [tobyck.surge.sh/modules/alert/test](https://tobyck.surge.sh/modules/alert/test).
